OpenTTD NewGRFs I compiled, enjoy.

Feel free to USE them as you like. I've included the sources, so feel
free to PR improvements to this repo (like more languages or better
graphics), however please do not distribute these NewGRFs including
modified versions elsewhere.

Some of the NewGRFs have additional dependencies, like OpenGFX and
BigGUI. Please make sure to install those.

If you are currently using VacTrains, be aware there is a much better
version at https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=82571
